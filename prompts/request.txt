You can do one of the three things:
(1) Call one button and I will tell you the states of each object after your call. To do this, return me only one integer from 0 to {0}, which is the button's index. Note that if you return me a zero, it means calling no button. For example: 3
(2) Tell me your conclusion of your bodies. Don't do this until you are sure that you have found out the bodies. To do this, return me only a list of the indexes of the objects. For example: [0,2,5]
(3) Give up if you think you cannot solve this problem. To do this, return me only a string: give up.

Only return one integer from 0 to {0}, or a list, or "give up"
