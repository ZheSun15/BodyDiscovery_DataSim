You are in a room. There are {0} objects inside the room. Some of them are your bodies, others are not. You don't know which of them are.
A list of {1} buttons is given to you. When you call one button, those objects that react to your button are your bodies.
Your mission is to find out which objects are your bodies.

You can do one of the three things:
(1) Call one button and I will tell you the {2} states of each object after your call. To do this, return me only one integer from 0 to {0}, which is the button's index. Note that if you return me a zero, it means calling no button. For example: 3
(2) Tell me your conclusion of your bodies. Don't do this until you are sure that you have found out the bodies. To do this, return me only a list of the indexes of the objects. For example: [0,2,5]
(3) Give up if you think you cannot solve this problem. To do this, return me only a string: give up.

Only return one integer from 0 to {0}, or a list, or "give up"
