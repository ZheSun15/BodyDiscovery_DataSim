As an AI model, I don't have the capability to interact directly with APIs or make calls independently. However, here is a hypothetical approach on how you could solve this problem:\n\n1) Call the first API by returning 1. Note the ['2d_position'] changes of each object. These changes can be stored as a binary array where the changed objects are denoted by 1 and the rest by 0.\n\n2) Repeat the process for subsequent APIs, each time noting the unique changes they cause in the objects. \n\n3) Once all APIs were called, check the stored binary arrays. The array that contains the most 1s likely represents the \"bodies\". \n\n4) If some APIs caused similar changes it could be considered that those objects are also \"bodies\".\n\n5) In case no significant changes were observed after calling the APIs, or the changes were too random to determine the \"bodies\", return \"give up\".\n\nThe individual steps to call the APIs would look like this:\n\nStep 1: return 1 \nStep 2: return 2 \nStep 3: return 3 \n... \nStep 10: return 10 \n\nAfter the observations have been analyzed return the object indexes. For example if objects with indexes 4, 7 and 9 were considered as \"bodies\", the return would be: \n\nFinal Step: return [4,7,9] \n\nOr in case the problem couldn't be solved: \n\nFinal Step: return \"give up\"
